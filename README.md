This is the contents of Koncepten but badly translated into english by me (SA0CVJ)  If you notice something very wrong or off then please drop me a message so I can fix it :) I only have 1 pair of eyes and I sort of speedran translating this lmao. Anyway,  Enjoy!!
I have also highlighted the parts that were most important for me when studying for the swedish version of the harec license,,, if youâ€™re doing other licenses then this might not be everything since they are a bit varied but if you read the contents of this and the really amazing irish book, you'll probably be ok lol
